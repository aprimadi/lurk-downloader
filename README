Intro:
Downloading manga from http://gotlurk.net takes a lot of work. One must go to
the website first, then find the manga to download and its corresponding
bot server and item number. Then, they must open IRC client and type 
  /msg <bot-name> xdcc send #<item-number>
Not to mention all that annoying pop-ups which crash your computers.

The goal of this project is to create a friendly user interface which shows a
list of manga to download and allows user to download gotlurk manga in one
click.
